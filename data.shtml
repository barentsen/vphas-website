        <h2>Data access</h2>
      </div>

      <p>Because VPHAS+ is
      an <a href="http://www.eso.org/sci/observing/PublicSurveys/sciencePublicSurveys.html">ESO
      Public Survey</a>, all data will be released to the
      public. Initial public data products include reduced images and
      unstacked single-band source lists. In the future, we envisage
      that well-validated catalogues will be made available that
      provide 5 optical photometric data points per source at an
      external (systematic) precision of 0.02—0.03 magnitudes on,
      finally, over 300 million objects. From late 2014, work has
      started on the first of these.</p>

      <p>
      <b>Data release 1</b><br/>
      The first public data release, VPHAS-DR1, was made available in 2013 through a <a href="http://www.eso.org/sci/observing/phase3/data_releases.html">dedicated page on the ESO website</a>. The release covers the first 9 months of data-taking in which a tenth of the survey footprint was observed to desired quality. These first pointings have favoured the Galactic equator and some well-known open clusters of interest to the Gaia-ESO Survey. The contents of the release are described in an <a href="https://www.eso.org/sci/observing/phase3/data_releases/vphasplus_dr1.pdf">accompanying document</a> and the reduced images and unstacked single-band source lists can be accessed through the <a href="http://archive.eso.org/wdb/wdb/adp/phase3_main/form?phase3_collection=VPHASplus&release_tag=1">ESO phase 3 query interface</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Data release 2</b><br/>
      The second public data release, VPHAS-DR2, is being made
      available in early 2015 through
      <a href="http://www.eso.org/sci/observing/phase3/data_releases.html">ESO's
      dedicated web pages</a> in the same way as VPHAS-DR1. The
      release covers the first 21 months of data-taking in which the
      survey progressed to 24 percent completion. The bias in favour
      of the Galactic equator continues to the extent that much of the
      mid-Plane is now done (especially in the r, i and Ha filters).
      The contents of the release are described
      in <a href="./release-description-dr2-jed.pdf">a
      second release document (current draft)</a>
      and the reduced images and unstacked single-band source lists
      will again be accessible through
      the <a href="http://archive.eso.org/wdb/wdb/adp/phase3_main/form?phase3_collection=VPHASplus&release_tag=2">ESO
      phase 3 query interface</a>, after data upload.

      On this page we will be providing links to advice and software
      that will aid users in customised bandmerging of the released data.

      <b>Data acknowledgment instructions</b><br/>
      Users of VPHAS+ data should cite <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1402.7024D">Drew et al (2014)</a> and acknowledge the source of the data as follows:
      </p>

      <blockquote style='font-size:0.95em;'>
      <p>
      Based on data products from observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under programme ID 177.D-3023, as part of the VST Photometric Hα Survey of the Southern Galactic Plane and Bulge (VPHAS+, www.vphas.eu).
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Known issues</b><br/>
      Like any other data set, VPHAS+ is affected by a number of caveats.
