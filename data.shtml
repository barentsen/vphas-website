        <h2>Data access</h2>
      </div>

      <p>Because VPHAS+ is an <a href="http://www.eso.org/sci/observing/PublicSurveys/sciencePublicSurveys.html">ESO Public Survey</a>, all data will be released to the public. Initial public data products include reduced images and unstacked single-band source lists. In the future, we envisage that a well-validated catalogue will be made available that provides 5 optical photometric data points per source at an external (systematic) precision of 0.02—0.03 magnitudes on around 200 million objects.</p>


      <p>
      <b>Data release 1</b><br/>
      The first public data release, VPHAS-DR1, was made available in 2013 through a <a href="http://www.eso.org/sci/observing/phase3/data_releases.html">dedicated page on the ESO website</a>. The release covers the first 9 months of data-taking in which a tenth of the survey footprint was observed to desired quality. These first pointings have favoured the Galactic equator and some well-known open clusters of interest to the Gaia-ESO Survey. The contents of the release are described in an <a href="https://www.eso.org/sci/observing/phase3/data_releases/vphasplus_dr1.pdf">accompanying document</a> and the reduced images and unstacked single-band source lists can be accessed through the <a href="http://archive.eso.org/wdb/wdb/adp/phase3_main/form?phase3_collection=VPHASplus&release_tag=1">ESO phase 3 query interface</a>.
