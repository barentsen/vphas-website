        <h2>Data access</h2>
      </div>

      <p>VPHAS+ is
      an <a href="http://www.eso.org/sci/observing/PublicSurveys/sciencePublicSurveys.html">ESO
      Public Survey</a>.  Hence all data will be released to the
      public. Initial data products include reduced images and
      unstacked single-band source lists. There will be a succession of 
      releases leading to the final goal of a well-validated 
      point source catalogue of u/g/r/i/H&alpha; photometry at an
      external (systematic) precision of 0.02â€”0.03 magnitudes on over 300 
      million objects.</p>

      <p>
      <b>Data release 1</b><br/>
      The first release of reduced images and single-band source lists, 
      VPHAS-DR1, that was based on 10% of the survey footprint and the first
      9 months of observing, was made available in 2013. It has been replaced 
      by the second data release.</p>

      <p>
      <b>Data release 2</b><br/>
      The second public data release, VPHAS-DR2, is now 
      available through
      <a href="http://www.eso.org/sci/observing/phase3/data_releases.html">ESO's
      public survey pages</a>. It covers the first 21 months of data-taking in 
      which the survey progressed to 24 percent completion. Much of the
      Galactic mid-plane is now covered (especially in the r, i and 
      H&alpha; filters).  

      The reduced images and unstacked single-band source lists can be 
      directly accessed via the <a href="http://archive.eso.org/wdb/wdb/adp/phase3_main/form?phase3_collection=VPHASplus&release_tag=2">ESO phase 3 query interface</a>. A copy of the release description is available <a href="../vphasplus-dr2-release-description.pdf">here</a>, while the following files list the 
      released red- and blue-filter data by name and sky coordinates:<br/>
      <a href="../dr2-hari-exposures.csv">dr2-hari-exposures.csv</a><br/>
      <a href="../dr2-ugr-exposures.csv">dr2-ugr-exposures.csv</a><br/>
      As many fields as possible have been included in DR2 even if, 
      occasionally, this means admitting some exposures subject to e.g. sky
      transparency changes.  Where there is a known data-quality issue it is 
      noted as a comment in these lists.</p> 

      <p>
      The means to custom band-merge data from the ESO archive or to convert 
      single-band fluxes into magnitudes is introduced <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewyh/vphas-bandmerge-standalone/master/README.md">here</a> 
      and download of the python software package is available <a href="https://github.com/lewyh/vphas-bandmerge-standalone">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b> Data release 2 - merged point source catalogue</b><br/>
      The VPHAS-DR2 Point Source Catalogue (PSC) is released and available 
      <a href="http://www.eso.org/qi/catalogQuery/index/59">from ESO</a> and 
      will soon be available via this site as well.  Band-merged PSF and 
      aperture photometry are provided for most of the DR2 sky area with an 
      approximate global calibration.  The  description of this data product is
      given <a href="../release-description-vphas-dr2-catalogue.pdf">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>New and known issues</b><br/>
      In common with other large pipelined datasets, VPHAS+ data
      occasionally present artefacts and niggles. Please refer to the 
      <a href="known-issues.shtml">dedicated
      web-page on known issues</a> identified in some data to learn
      more.<br/>
      Users of VPHAS+ data are also strongly encouraged to report new
      issues or difficulties encountered to feed into the continuing 
      development of data products.  Please use our 
      <a href="bug_report.php">bug report form</a> to do this. 
      </p>

      

      <p>
      <b>Data acknowledgment instructions</b><br/>
      Users of VPHAS+ data should cite <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1402.7024D">Drew et al (2014)</a> and acknowledge the source of the data as follows:
