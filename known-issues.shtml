<h1>Known issues in VPHAS+ data</h1>

<p>Owing to the good optical quality of the VST,
and to the quality control procedures which are applied
by both ESO and the survey team,
the quality of VPHAS+ data tends to be excellent.
Like any other data set however, VPHAS+ is affected by
a number of caveats.
This page summarises a range of issues presently known.
</p>

<div class="page-header">
  <h2 id="straylight">Stray light</h2>
</div>

<h3 id="flats">Flat-fielding errors</h3>

<p>
All the VST/OmegaCAM exposures are known to contain a significant component
of stray light, which is dominated by a centrally concentrated radial pattern
which causes the flat-field frames to be "overexposed" in the center
of the FOV. As a result, the flat-fielded science images contain an
artificial zeropoint gradient of up to ~10%,
which needs to be corrected for
in order to achieve a good photometric calibration.
A discussion on the issue is offered in 
Sect 2.9 of <a href="http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/omegacam/doc.html">the OmegaCAM manual</a>,
and in the dedicted <a href="http://wiki.astro-wise.org/_media/projects:omegacam:portal:ocam_illum.pdf">OmegaCAM commissioning report</a>.
Details on how the VPHAS+ survey mitigates the issue is found in
Sect 2.3.3 of the <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.7024v2.pdf">VPHAS+ introductory paper</a>,
and on the <a href="http://casu.ast.cam.ac.uk/surveys-projects/vst/technical/scattered-light-and-illumination-correction">CASU webpage</a> on the topic.
</p>

<h3 id="ghosts">Ghosts and stripes</h3>

<p>
Apart from the radially concentrated stray light which is present
in <em>all the images</em>, the data is also affected by reflections
on small spatial scales.
For example, bright stars trigger several ghost images 
which are reasonably well-focused.
An example is shown below.
A characterisation of the ghosts is given in Sect 3.7.3
of <a href="http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/omegacam/doc.html">the OmegaCAM manual</a>.

</i>
</p>

<h3 id="lines">Wispy lines</h3>

<p>
VPHAS+ frames are occasionally found to show wispy lines, bright streaks,
and background gradients which are not well understood at present.
The working hypothesis is that these features are the result of
stray light from an unknown origin, possibly a bright star
outside of the field of view.
</p>

<p>
In particular, we warn users that some of the wispy lines
may be mistaken for the pattern produced by a supernova remnant.
Fields which are known to include wispy lines are
0004, 0005, 0032, 0034, 0035,
0082, 0636, 0687, 0688, 0712,
0713, 0714, 0774, 0775, 0798,
0799, 0800, 0825, 0826, 0853,
0878, 0903, 1501, 1669, 1817b,
1818, 1850, and 1959.
</p>

<p>A few examples are shown below.</p>

</p>


<h3 id="streaks">Streaks and gradients</h3>

<p>
Stray light is also seen in extended shapes
and gradients. The example below shows a streak
of light scattered into the image from an unknown source.

<div class="page-header">
  <h2 id="pointing">Pointing accuracy</h2>
</div>

<p>
The pointing of the VST has been found to show a systematic errors
of up to 30 arcsec between different nights.
The one-sigma residual between the requested and the observed position
equals 7 arcsec (as measured using the VPHAS data taken in 2012 and 2013).
The red (Ha, r, i) and blue (u, g, r) concatenations are nearly
always observed on separate nights, and hence the CCD frames
of the six bands do not usually show a perfect overlap in the sky
as a result of the pointing errors.
</p>

<p>
An example is field 1921, which was observed in the night of
2013-01-30 (red bands) and 2013-04-02 (blue bands).
The data from these two nights show a systematic shift in the pointing
of 30 arcsec in RA and 15 arcsec in Dec.
As a result, the area in the sky where all 6 bands overlap
was reduced by 18% compared to the ideal case.
Most fields show less extreme shifts however.
</p>

<p>
The pointing errors are largely mitigated by the fact that each VPHAS
field is paired with an offset pointing at a distance of -588 arcsec in RA and +660 arcsec in Dec, which is a strategy designed to cover the inter-CCD gaps.
The pointing errors will increase the small uncovered rectangles which are created where inter-CCD gaps overlap, but these rectangles only comprise
about 3% of the footprint.
</p>

</p>


<div class="page-header">
  <h2 id="filters">Filter issues</h2>
</div>

<p>
Users need to be aware of two filter issues:
<ul>
<li>the u-band filter is known to contain a small red leak,
which may cause bright red stars to be mistaken for UV-bright stars;</li>
<li>the H-alpha filter is subject to a variation in the transmission profile across the field, in part due to its (segmented) construction.</li>
</ul>
More information on these issues is contained in the <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.7024v2.pdf">VPHAS+ introductory paper</a>.
