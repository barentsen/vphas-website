<b>Survey footprint</b>
<br/> 
The main survey strip is 10 degrees wide and is defined in Galactic
  coordinates as all latitudes within 5 degrees of the Galactic
  Equator (GE).  There are two Bulge extensions that expand this
  latitude range to 10 degrees away from the GE.  It takes a tiling of 
  2269 OmegaCam fields to cover the &tilde;2000 sq.deg footprint
</p>

<p>
<b>Proposed data acquisition strategy</b><br/>
The original plan was to observe every field contemporaneously in
the Sloan u, g, r and i broadbands, and also in H&alpha; narrowband
(using the segmented filter constructed for this survey, named
NB_659) - and to repeat these exposures in a suitably chosen offset
position.
</p>  

<p>
<b>Actual pattern</b><br/> 
For VST operational reasons the consortium was
asked by ESO to split the data-taking, executing the blue/red filters in
darker/brighter time.  To meet this request, we submit separated u/g/r and
Ha/r/i observing blocks to the queue, including r band exposures in
both sets so that the two filter sets may be tied together post-observing
(as desired).
</p>   

<p>
<b>Survey depth and seeing targets</b><br/>
The aim is 5&sigma; in all filters down to at least
&tilde;20th magnitude (Vega system).  The high quality of the Paranal site is
likely to mean this will usually be bettered, particularly in g and r.  Typical survey seeing
is expected to be close to 1 arcsec, improving to &tilde;0.8-0.9
arcsec in the densest fields.

</p>

<p>
<b>Offsetting strategy</b><br/>
Refer to the figure above.  For the broadband
exposures the
outermost placements (black, blue) of the OmegaCam footprint will be
used.  For NB_659 exposures, the effects of vignetting due to
the segment separators have to be countered by taking data in a
third intermediate offset position (shown in green).
</p>

<p>
<b>Properties of the NB_659 filter</b><br/>
This segmented filter was purchased by members of the VPHAS+
consortium.  It was received and tested in Munich in 2009, and
checked again before delivery to Paranal in 2011 (the combined test
reports are <a href="filter-report.pdf">here</a>).  Its stability in
operation on the VST has been monitored to late 2012 and is
summarised <a href="ESO_filter_report_NB659.pdf">here</a>.

The image below shows the VPHAS+ survey footprint plotted in Galactic coordinates. All 2269 fields are shown in outline. Different colours are used to identify the observations obtained for each field by the end of August 2015.
