<p><b>Survey footprint</b><br> 
The main survey strip is 10 degrees wide and is defined in Galactic
  coordinates as all latitudes within 5 degrees of the Galactic
  Equator (GE).  There are two Bulge extensions that expand this
  latitude range to 10 degrees away from the GE.  It takes a tiling of 
  2269 OmegaCam fields to cover the &tilde;2000 sq.deg footprint</p>

<p><b>Proposed data acquisition strategy</b><br> 
  The original plan was to observe every field contemporaneously in
  the Sloan u, g, r and i broadbands, and also in H&alpha; narrowband
  (using the segmented filter constructed for this survey, named
  NB_659) - and to repeat these exposures in a suitably chosen offset
  position.</p>  

<p><b>Actual pattern</b><br> 
  For VST operational reasons the consortium was
  asked by ESO to split the data-taking, executing the blue/red filters in
  darker/brighter time.  To meet this request, we submit separated u/g/r and
  Ha/r/i observing blocks to the queue, including r band exposures in
  both sets so that the two filter sets may be tied together post-observing
  (as desired).</p>   

<p><b>Survey depth and seeing targets</b><br> 
The aim is 5&sigma; in all filters down to at least
  &tilde;20th magnitude (Vega system).  The high quality of the Paranal site is
  likely to mean this will usually be bettered, particularly in g and r.  Typical survey seeing
  is expected to be close to 1 arcsec, improving to &tilde;0.8-0.9
  arcsec in the densest fields.</p>

<p><b>Offsetting strategy</b><br>  
  Refer to the figure above.  For the broadband
  exposures the
  outermost placements (black, blue) of the OmegaCam footprint will be
  used.  For NB_659 exposures, the effects of vignetting due to
  the segment separators have to be countered by taking data in a
  third intermediate offset position (shown in green).</p>

<p><b>Properties of the NB_659 filter</b><br>
  This segmented filter was purchased by members of the VPHAS+
  consortium.  It was received and tested in Munich in 2009, and
  checked again before delivery to Paranal in 2011 (the combined test
  reports are <a href="filter-report.pdf">here</a>).  Its stability in
  operation on the VST has been monitored to late 2012 and is
  summarised <a href="ESO_filter_report_NB659.pdf">here</a>.</p>
